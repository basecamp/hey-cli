A CLI and TUI for [HEY](https://hey.com).

*Read and send emails, manage boxes, calendars, todos, habits, time tracking, and journal entries — all from your terminal.*

## Install

Requires Go 1.26+. Use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) to install the correct version:

```bash
mise install       # install Go 1.26
make install       # build and install into /usr/local/bin/hey
```

## Authentication

```bash
# Browser-based OAuth via Launchpad (primary method)
hey auth login

# Or use a pre-generated token
hey auth login --token TOKEN

# Or use a browser session cookie
hey auth login --cookie COOKIE
```

Tokens refresh automatically on expiry. Credentials are stored in the system keyring (with file fallback at `~/.config/hey-cli/credentials.json`).

```bash
hey auth status   # check auth status
hey auth token    # print access token for scripting
hey auth refresh  # force token refresh
hey auth logout   # clear credentials
```

### Linked accounts

One HEY login exposes every mail account linked to that identity. List the available
filters, persist a default, or select one for a single invocation:

```bash
hey accounts list                 # list All Accounts and each linked account
hey accounts use 12345            # persist a linked account as the default mail filter
hey accounts use all              # return to All Accounts
hey --account 12345 boxes         # override the default for one invocation
HEY_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 hey search "quarterly planning"
```

The default is `all`. Selection precedence is `--account`, `HEY_ACCOUNT_ID`, trusted local
`.hey/config.json`, the global default for the active server, then All Accounts. Global
account defaults are stored separately for each server origin, so development and production
selections cannot affect one another. Explicit and persisted IDs are validated against the
signed-in identity before mail requests, so an unavailable account fails closed.

The first command that would use a repository-local server or account setting asks whether to
use it once, always trust its current values, or cancel. Non-interactive and JSON commands fail
closed until you explicitly run `hey config trust-local` from that directory. Changes to the
local server or account invalidate trust. Review trust with `hey config trusted-locals` and
remove it with `hey config untrust-local`.

Compose and contact creation use an individually selected account; replies and forwards use
the thread's account. Calendars, todos, habits, time tracking, and journal entries remain
identity-wide.

## TUI

Run `hey` to launch the interactive terminal UI. For identities with multiple linked mail
accounts, press Ctrl+A to switch between All Accounts and individual email addresses.
Switching cancels requests from the previous account and reloads the active section;
Calendar and Journal remain identity-wide.

Navigate between Mail, Contacts, Calendar, and Journal. In Mail, use `/` to search, Enter to open a thread, `r` to reply, `f` to forward, `m` to move, `t` to trash, `s` to mark as spam, `-` to ignore, and `+` to stop ignoring. Select threads with Space and press `b` to preview every bulk-reply recipient before writing and sending one reply to all selected threads. A delayed bulk reply can be recalled with `u` while HEY's undo window remains open. Search results retain the matching-message summary; use `n` and `p` to move between result pages.

Thread attachments always appear with their filename, media type, and size. Use `[` and `]` to select an attachment, `s` to save it without replacing an existing file, and `o` to download and open it in an external application. Attachments never open automatically. Kitty and Ghostty can show inline images. Foot and other terminals use visible text markers.

Press Shift+O to open Contacts. Use Enter to view a contact, `a` to add, `e` to edit, `n` to edit the private note, `x` twice to delete a note, `h` to hide, and `u` to show the most recently hidden contact again. Escape or `q` goes back.

## CLI Commands

Structured data commands support `--json` for full output and `--jq '<expression>'` to
filter that output without an external `jq` binary. `--jq` implies `--json` and filters
the full success envelope; combine it with `--quiet` to filter result data directly.
Errors retain their complete structured envelope. Commands with dedicated raw output
(`auth token`, `completion`, `skill`, `tui`, and `--version`) reject `--jq`.

Use `--base-url` to override the server URL and `--account <id|all>` to select a linked
mail account.

```bash
hey boxes --jq '.data[] | {id, name}'
hey boxes --quiet --jq '.[].id'
```

### Email

```bash
hey boxes                          # list mailboxes
hey box imbox                      # list email threads in a box (by name or ID)
hey search "quarterly planning"    # search threads and matching messages
hey search --from jane@example.com --date last_30_days  # refine a search
hey search filters                 # list available refinement values
hey contacts list                  # list contacts
hey contacts show 12345            # view a contact and private note
hey contacts add --name "Jane Doe" --email jane@example.com
hey contacts update 12345 --name "Jane Dawson"
hey contacts hide 12345            # hide without permanently deleting
hey contacts show-again 12345      # show a hidden contact again
hey contacts bundle 12345          # group this contact's mail into one row
hey contacts unbundle 12345        # list this contact's mail separately
hey contacts note set 12345 "Prefers email"
hey contacts note delete 12345
hey threads 123                    # read a full email thread
hey attachments 123                # list files attached to the thread
hey attachments save 456:1         # save a file using its attachment ID
hey reply 123 -m "Thanks!"        # reply to a thread (or omit -m to open $EDITOR)
hey reply 123 -m "Attached." --attach ./diagram.png
hey bulk-reply preview 12345 67890  # inspect threads and exact To/CC/BCC recipients
hey bulk-reply send 12345 67890 -m "Thanks for the update."
hey bulk-reply undo 98765            # recall a delayed bulk reply
hey forward 123 --to alice@example.com -m "For your review"  # forward the latest message
hey compose --to user@example.com --subject "Hello"  # compose a new message
hey compose --to user@example.com --subject "Report" -m "Attached." --attach ./report.pdf
hey compose --to user@example.com --cc bob@example.com --bcc carol@example.org --subject "Hello"  # with CC/BCC
hey drafts                         # list drafts
hey move 12345 --to feed --kind topic  # move an email thread to another box
hey move 12345 67890 --to "paper trail" --kind topic  # move multiple email threads
hey trash 12345 --kind topic       # move an email thread to Trash
hey spam 12345                     # mark a thread as spam
hey ignore 12345 --kind topic      # ignore future activity on an email thread
hey stop-ignoring 12345            # resume attention for a thread
```

Search accepts free text plus `--required`, `--any`, `--none`, `--exact`, `--from`, `--to`, `--subject`, `--date`, `--in`, `--label`, and `--attachment`. Use `--page` for one page or `--all` to fetch up to 100 pages; capped searches report the next page for continuation. Search results include `topic_id` for reading the thread and the matching message summaries. Results with an active box item also include `id` for organization actions.

Contact updates preserve omitted name, email, and alias fields. Supplying `--alias` replaces the complete alias list; `--alias=` clears it. Contact notes accept positional content, `--note`, stdin, or `$EDITOR`. HEY hides contacts rather than permanently deleting them; hidden contacts leave lists, autocomplete, and search, and can be shown again by ID. Bundling groups a contact's mail into one row without merging or deleting the underlying threads; unbundling lists those threads separately again. HEY applies bundling when the contact's current delivery setting supports bundles.

`hey bulk-reply preview` is read-only and resolves each posting to its latest replyable entry. `hey bulk-reply send` resolves the selection again, skips threads without a replyable entry, keeps HEY's server-provided name tag, and returns the exact reply count, delivery ID, delayed state, undo URL, and undo command. Posting IDs must be positive and unique. The message can come from `-m`, stdin, or `$EDITOR`; `--attach` is repeatable.

`--attach` is repeatable on `hey compose`, `hey reply`, and `hey bulk-reply send`, and attachment-only messages are supported. The CLI validates and uploads every file before sending the email. `hey attachments <topic_id>` returns stable message-and-position IDs such as `456:1`; pass an ID to `hey attachments save`. Saving uses the original filename by default, accepts `--output` for a file or directory, and preserves existing files unless `--force` is set.

Organization actions take the `id` values returned by `hey box --json` or `hey search --json`. `move`, `trash`, and `ignore` only manage email threads and require the exact flag `--kind topic`; missing and non-email kinds are rejected before setup or any request. The CLI does not manage HEY World posts. Move destinations are Imbox, The Feed, Set Aside, Reply Later, or Paper Trail. Bubble Up requires a scheduled date and is not available through `hey move`. Trashing a shared thread removes your access instead of deleting it for everyone. Ignored threads remain in their box and can be restored with `hey stop-ignoring`.

### Calendars

```bash
hey calendars                      # list calendars
hey recordings 1 --starts-on 2026-01-01 --ends-on 2026-01-31  # list events in a calendar
```

### Todos

```bash
hey todo list                      # list todos
hey todo add "Buy milk"            # create a todo
hey todo complete 1                # mark done
hey todo uncomplete 1              # mark undone
hey todo delete 1                  # delete
```

### Habits

```bash
hey habit complete 1               # mark habit done (today or --date YYYY-MM-DD)
hey habit uncomplete 1             # undo habit completion
```

### Time tracking

```bash
hey timetrack start                # start tracking
hey timetrack stop                 # stop tracking
hey timetrack current              # show active track
hey timetrack list                 # list all tracks
```

### Journal

```bash
hey journal list                   # list entries
hey journal read                   # read today's entry (or pass YYYY-MM-DD)
hey journal write "..."            # write today's entry (or omit content for $EDITOR)
```

## Agent Skill

hey-cli ships with an embedded agent skill so your agent can interact with HEY on your behalf.

```bash
hey skill install   # install the skill globally for your agent
```

## Development

```bash
make build      # build binary
make test       # run tests
make coverage   # run cross-package coverage and enforce the 70.8% floor
make lint       # run golangci-lint
make clean      # remove build artifacts
```

`make coverage` writes `coverage.out`, `coverage.func.txt`, and `coverage.packages.txt`, then prints a concise package summary and the lowest-covered functions.
